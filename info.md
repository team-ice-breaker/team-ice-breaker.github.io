## Metrics
We've decided to collect and report the following metrics –

- Velocity
- Developer happiness

Happiness is measured on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). We plan to use happiness to identify and resolve team issues.

## Development Methodology
We've selected Scrum for our development methodology. Our daily stand-ups will run asynchronously using Slack. Team members are responsible for reporting –

- what they've worked on
- what they plan to work on
- time spent
- blockers
- project happiness
